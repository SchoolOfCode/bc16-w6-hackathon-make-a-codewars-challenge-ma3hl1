Welcome! Aspiring witches and wizards, to your online enrollment for joining Hogwarts!

The sorting hat is taking a much deserved break!
As such, you are required to code a function that will take the roll of the sorting hat for the duration of it's holiday.

The role of the sorting hat is to sort students into one of 4 possible Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and (the superior) Slytherin).
As we do not have the hats' amazing intuition, we will be doing this randomly instead.

However, the hat does also take into account the preferences of the students, and therefore your function must also do the same.
All students have the option to choose which house they are sorted into, should they be inclined to do so.

If the student selects an unfamiliar house, the hat should retort "That's not a Hogwarts house! Go to Beauxbatons!".

Upon being sorted into a house, the hat function should exclaim "Welcome to {house}!".

The holiday is equivalent to 144 sorts (as this is the approximate number of new students every year).
(So the function should run only 144 times and no more than this).
After this, the function will retort "I'm retired! Leave me alone!"
